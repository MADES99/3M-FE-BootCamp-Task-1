#A Facebook Log-in Page

The Facebook Log-in Page is built with the knowledge of HTML and CSS. 
This task serves as proof of the knowledge gained from the 3-month Front-end boot camp currently undertaken.
The Page is also responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
The 'forgot password?', 'create a new account', and 'create page' links are also active.
